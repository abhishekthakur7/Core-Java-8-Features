	/*Java 5 introduced java.util.concurrent.Callable interface in concurrency package that is similar 
	to Runnable interface but it can return any Object and able to throw Exception.
	
	Java Callable interface use Generic to define the return type of Object. Executors class 
	provide useful methods to execute Java Callable in a thread pool. Since callable
	tasks run in parallel, we have to wait for the returned Object.
	
	Java Callable tasks return java.util.concurrent.Future object. Using Java Future object, 
	we can find out the status of the Callable task and get the returned Object. It provides get() 
	method that can wait for the Callable to finish and then return the result.

	Java Future provides cancel() method to cancel the associated Callable task. There is an 
	overloaded version of get() method where we can specify the time to wait for the result, itï¿½s 
	useful to avoid current thread getting blocked for longer time. There are isDone() and 
	isCancelled() methods to find out the current status of associated Callable task.
